# sg_dataset

Honestly, [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg) has a pretty nice UI/UX.

However, I still prefer the full listing in CSV file and download the data through RStudio.

Use [listing.]("http://github.com/artidata/sg_dataset/blob/master/listing.R") to navigate and download dataset of interest.
